<p class ="text">Advantech has done everything possible to fulfill your order correctly and pack it to ensure that your order arrives at your destination intact and without damage. We do realize however, that mistakes happen and occasionally shipping damage does occur. With this in mind, we wish to convey our current policy for shipping damage claims and shortage claims after receipt at the location specified on the Advantech packing list. The following policy is only valid for shipments made within the Australia.
<p><strong>Shipping Damage</strong><br />
  For both externally visible and internally hidden shipping damage upon arrival at the first point of delivery, Advantech's eStore/Advantech and receiver will have to file the claim with the carrier within 5 working days. During this initial 5 working days, this exchange will be without charge to you, except that you must pay for all transportation and insurance charges for the replacement products to be shipped to the designated delivery point. In no case will Advantech be liable for any shipping damages 5-days after received of shipment or after the shipment has been forwarded on beyond the point of delivery specified on the Advantech packing list.
</p>
<p><strong>Incorrect Shipment</strong><br />
  Advantech makes every effort to make sure the items and quantities on the packing slip are included in your shipment. If you find that an item has been inadvertently left out of a shipment, or that the products in the shipment do not match the packing slip, Advantech will within 2 working days after receipt, replace the item(s) if we can verify through our internal processes that a shortage or error has occurred. The replacement will occur without charge to you, however you must report the error within 5 working days after receipt. Under no circumstances will Advantech honor any claims for shortages after the 5 working days time period has elapsed or after it has been forwarded beyond the point of delivery as specified on the Advantech packing list.
