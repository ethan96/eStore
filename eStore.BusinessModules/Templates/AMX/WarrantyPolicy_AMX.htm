            <br />
            The owner shall prepay shipping charges (and pay all applicable duties, taxes, and other such charges) when returning products to Advantech for repair service.

            <span class="blueTitle">SHIPPING DAMAGE AND WARRANTY:</span>
            <br />
            Damage or any loss to Advantech equipment caused by any transportation service while enroute to the customer is not considered a product defect and therefore ineligible for warranty service. All Advantech equipment is shipped FOB Shipping Point so the responsibility for loss or damage claims to transportation services is the responsibility of the purchaser. If Advantech is notified of loss or shipping damages within 5 days after invoice date, Advantech may assist the customer with filing the claim and coordinate the repair or replacement of the product with any compensation provided by the transportation company.
